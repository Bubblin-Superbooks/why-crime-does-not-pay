<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">front of the side door, was "Big Tom" Bigelow. He was the "outside man" of the job and, although I could not see him, I knew he was on the alert to intercept anybody who might happen in. With some excuse he must stop any clerk who tried to enter through the side doorâ€”I myself must intercept any clerk who might chance to return from lunch and enter by the front entrance.</p></div> </div>
