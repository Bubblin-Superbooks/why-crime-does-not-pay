He was a copper-colored, long-haired old chief, with Indian baskets and strings of beads on his arms. As soon as the girls and I stepped out of the prison gate this queer looking, bent old man singled us out from all the rest of the crowd and began following us about, urging us with muffled grunts to buy some  of the bead goods he carried in a basket strapped around his neck.</p><p>I thought he was crazy and told him very emphatically that I didn't want any of his trash. But this did not discourage him in the least, and he dogged our footsteps wherever we went.</p><p>At last—more to be rid of the old fellow than because I wanted anything he had—I selected from his stock a pair of bead slippers.</p><p>As I handed him the money I felt him press a little folded slip of paper into the hollow of my hand.</p></div> </div>
