<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Half way up a long hill, down which the coach  would come, the three men concealed themselvesâ€”Raymond and the captain on one side of the road, King on the other.</p><p>Around a tree on either side of the road they fastened the rope with a slip noose, letting its length lie loose on the ground directly in the path of the coach. Carefully loading their revolvers they settled down to wait for its approach.</p><p>At last their ears caught the rumble of its wheels and presently the four horses which drew the heavy vehicle and its precious contents appeared above the crest of the hill. They were making good time on the last lap of their long journey from the mines.</p><p>On they came, until the hoofs of the leaders were within a foot of the rope. Raymond gave a shrill whistle and his companions stretched the rope tight across the road at a distance of about two feet above the ground.</p></div> </div>
