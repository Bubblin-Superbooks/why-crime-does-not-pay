For months he had been racking his brain for some way of averting the ruin which he had brought upon himself.</p><p>The plan he had finally devised for retaining his good name and keeping out of prison was to have his bank robbed. On the night of the robbery he would leave $50,000 in the vault to pay the robbers for their trouble, but, when he came to announce the robbery to the police and the newspapers, he would declare that $200,000 had been taken.</p><p>In this way his thefts would be covered up and he could continue to enjoy the respect and confidence of the community where he had always lived.</p></div> </div>
