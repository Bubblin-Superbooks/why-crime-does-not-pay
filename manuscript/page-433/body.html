There was no sign of lifeâ€”no sound except the heavy breathing of the sleeping cashier and his family in the rooms above. I closed the door gently for fear the rasping of the drills on the metal of the safe would be heard.</p><p>Just then my quick ears caught the sound of some one in the passageway.
