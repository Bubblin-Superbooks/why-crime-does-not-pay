Just at his lips the glass stopped and the woman could not avoid a shudder, she covered her eyes and Grady, used to reading  people's minds, read hers. He let the glass fall and shouted:</p><p>"So, it's murder you wantâ€”well, murder it shall be, but I'll do the murdering."</p><p>She saw death in his eyes as he seized her arm but before death he would first have his way with her. She screamed and, pulling with the strength of despair, twisted the arm out of Grady's grasp, leaving half her sleeve in his hand.</p><p>Still, there could surely be no hope for her, and yet at that very instant when he poised himself to plunge after her again, his eyes turned glassy; paralysis seized him, and he sank slowly into his chair while the fainting woman tottered out of the door.</p></div> </div>
