<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was when I was on my way back from an unsuccessful bank robbing expedition to a Canadian town. I was feeling tired, out of sorts and generally disgusted with myself. "If I ever get back to my home in New York," I said to myself remorsefully, "I will surely settle down to an honest life."</p><p>But alas for all my good intentions! Just before I reached Springfield I happened to recall that this was where an old school friend of mine lived. She  was a thoroughly respectable woman, the wife of a hard working tradesman, and I determined to stop off and surprise her with a visit.</p><p>As luck would have it, I found her house locked, and one of her neighbors told me that she was away visiting her mother in Worcester. Knowing no one else in Springfield, there was nothing for me to do but kill time for two or three hours until another train left for New York.</p></div> </div>
