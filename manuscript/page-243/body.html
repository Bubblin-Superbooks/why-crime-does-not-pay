He was a cool, resourceful fellow and had had wide experience in blowing open bank vaults.</p><p>George readily agreed to join me, and for the rest of the party he recommended two younger menâ€”Tom Smith and Frank Jones, I will call them, although those were not their names. I do not like to reveal their identity here because they later reformed and led honest lives.</p><p>Right here let me say that I never told these three men of my arrangements with the banker or that I was to receive from him $10,000 in addition to what we expected to find in the vault. If they are alive to-day and read these lines they will learn here for the first time that the bank in Quincy, Ill., which they helped Sophie Lyons rob was robbed by request of its president.</p></div> </div>
