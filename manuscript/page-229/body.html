<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">midnight I stole out of the railroad station, where I had been waiting ostensibly for the night train to New York, and hid myself in the doorway of a livery stable, where I had a good view of the store we were going to rob.</p><p>Pretty soon I saw my two comrades come cautiously down the main street from opposite directions. They met underneath a window of the store on the side which was in the dark shadow of a tree.</p><p>The window was so high above the ground that my husband had to climb up on George Mason's shoulders to reach it. I could hear the gentle rasp of his jimmy as it worked against the fastenings.</p><p>At last he raised the sash gently and stepped into the store. Then he leaned far out across the sill and stretched his brawny arms down toward his companion.</p><p>Mason gave a leap, caught hold of Ned's wrists,  and, with the agility of a circus performer, swung himself up into the window.</p></div> </div>
