His amiable smile faded from his lips as he came face to face with an empty gilt frame.</p><p>The great $125,000 painting had been cut from its frame.</p><p>Who stole this masterpiece? How was it stolen? Could it be recovered?</p><p>The best detectives of Europe and America were asked to find answers to these questions. They never did. I will answer them here for the first time to-day.</p><p>The man who cut the Gainsborough from its frame was a millionaire, he was an associate of mine, he was a bank burglar. Adam Worth, or Harry Raymond, as he was known to his friends, did not need the money and he did not want the paintingâ€”he entered that London art gallery at 3 o'clock in the morning and took that roll of canvas  out under his arm for a purpose that nobody suspected. I will explain all this presently.</p></div> </div>
